Given two integers, X and Y, find their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

Constraints
-100 <=X,Y<=100

Four lines containing the sum (X+Y), difference (X-Y), product (X*Y), and quotient (X/Y), respectively.
(While computing the quotient, print only the integer part.)
Sample Input

5
2

Sample Output

7
3
10
2

Explanation

5 + 2 = 7
5 - 2 = 3
5 * 2 = 10
5 / 2 = 2 (Integer part)
